# ALU-UVM
Designed a 32-bit ALU supporting add, sub, mul, div, and, or, xor, sll, srl, sra, rol, ror, eq, neq, sgt, and slt operations. Built a UVM testbench with randomized stimulus, monitor, and scoreboard using a reference model to verify outputs, ensuring functional correctness across varied scenarios.
